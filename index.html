  <body>
  <p>
   For every inference sentence of a given image, we add a negative inference sentence that is taken from the same image.
   The first 5000 or so examples of these "event sentence + positive/negative inference statement" from the test dataset
   are shown in the table below.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our model scored an 83.57% accuracy on the test data. Other evaluation metrics are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>precision (PPV): 85.53%</li>
      <li>recall (TPR): 82.13%</li>
      <li>NPV: 82.81%</li>
      <li>specificity (TNR): 86.11%</li>
    </ul>
