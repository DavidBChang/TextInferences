 <p>
 For every multiple choice example, we chose negative inference choices that are of the same inference type as
 the ground truth but taken from different images, where the negatives and
 ground truth have a cosine similarity of less than 0.25.
 We show the first 5000 or so multiple choice examples from the test dataset
 in the table below. We used Roberta pretrained model and RobertaForMultipleChoice.
 </p>
 <p>
 Our model scored an 78.84% accuracy on the test data. The answer choices that are predicted incorrectly are
 highlighted in pink, while the ground truth is highlighted in green.
